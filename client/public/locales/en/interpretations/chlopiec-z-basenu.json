  "content": [
    "The poem 'The Boy from the Pool' is a profound meditation on the duality of soul and body. The figure of the boy, described as a 'clump of badly glued cells' and a 'living marionette on strings of unequal lengths,' is a tragic symbol of life imprisoned in an imperfect, physical form. Paradoxically, his disability does not rob him of joy ('he limps joyfully'), suggesting that his inner essence remains untouched by bodily limitations.",
    "The central image is the moment of emergence from the water. The boy 'crawls out,' undergoing a metamorphosis ('metamorphosed'), which evokes a primordial act of creation or birth. The water here is a symbolic womb from which life emerges, yet it is a life marked by flaws from the very beginning. Clinging 'to the rubber surface' emphasizes the transition from a fluid, unformed state to the hard, limited reality of the material world.",
    "The poem culminates in a fundamental metaphysical question: 'Did his soul wander before the birth of the body, before it entered it?'. This question elevates the poem from a physical observation to a philosophical debate on the pre-existence of the soul. It suggests that the soul is a primary and perfect entity that has been trapped in a random, imperfect body. The boy's tragedy lies not in his disability, but in a cosmic mistake that bound a pure soul to flawed matter."
