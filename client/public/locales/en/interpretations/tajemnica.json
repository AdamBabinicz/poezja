  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'The Secret'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'The Secret' is a manifesto against human cognitive hubris and a praise of humble endurance. Asking a question is presented here not as an act of seeking wisdom, but as a sin that 'disturbs the harmony of the world.' In the world described by the poem, order and balance are based on the acceptance of ignorance. 'Prometheus,' the archetype of the rebel seeking knowledge for humanity, must be punished for attempting to unveil 'the covered secret.'",
    "The central theme is the idea of a divine equality in ignorance. In the face of the ultimate secret, geniuses are 'on par' with the 'common,' which nullifies human intellectual hierarchies. No one will know the truth because the divine order is based on the cyclical erasure of memory. A 'new beginning,' which erases 'what was and what is to be,' is a mechanism that protects the secret of creation from human reason, ensuring that no one has 'enough time' to learn it.",
    "The final line—'Endurance - that is all there is'—is the poem's ultimate thesis. The highest form of existence is not knowledge, struggle, or questioning, but a simple, unreflective endurance in harmony with the secret. The poem becomes a critique of the Western, Faustian obsession with knowledge, and at the same time, an apotheosis of an Eastern philosophy of acceptance and being in the here and now, in a world whose ultimate nature will forever remain veiled."
