  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'The Future'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'The Future' is a dark elegy about a journey through life that is devoid of purpose and hope from the very beginning. 'The pillars of the future cast a shadow,' suggesting that the future is not a promise of light but a source of darkness that determines the present. The lyrical subject walks a path knowing they will never reach their destination, which makes their journey an act of tragic, existential resignation.",
    "The central theme is the process of purification through regret and suffering. The subject leaves behind 'regret and sadness' for 'Those with whom I have never been,' indicating a nostalgia for unrealized relationships and potential. 'Tears of purification,' flowing in 'deep furrows,' symbolize the painful but necessary process of confronting one's own past and wickedness. Suffering becomes a tool of moral transformation.",
    "The poem's finale brings a rejection of traditional values and a striving for annihilation. Wisdom proves useless in the face of death, which equates 'fools with the wise.' The ultimate goal becomes 'untying the knots' with 'maternal life' (symbolizing a physical, entangled existence) and achieving 'perfection in non-existence.' The future is not an end in itself, but merely a path leading to liberation through nothingness."
