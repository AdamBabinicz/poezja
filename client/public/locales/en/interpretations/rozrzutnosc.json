  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'Wastefulness'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'Wastefulness' is a shocking meditation on the cosmic scale of unrealized potential. The lyrical subject focuses not on existing life, but on the 'faces of people who were never born.' The image of 'trillions of trillions of unconnected eggs and sperm' brutally illustrates the vastness of existence that was passed over, rendering our reality a mere tiny, accidental fraction of what could have been.",
    "The central point of the work is a painful, theological question: 'Why did God not love them?'. This is not a request for understanding, but an accusation hurled at divine indifference or arbitrariness. The poem challenges the idea of an omnipotent, loving creative force by confronting it with the immeasurable scope of potential beings who were denied love and a chance at existence. This undermines the foundations of an order based on divine providence.",
    "The conclusion introduces the theme of solitary mourning. 'The few who mourn their non-existence' are those who possess the tragic awareness of this cosmic loss. Their grief is not for death, but for non-birth, a burden that cannot be shared with the rest of the world. The poem becomes a lament over the unimaginable wastefulness of nature or God, with the poet's role being to bear witness and mourn for what never was."
