  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'The Promise'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'The Promise' is a manifesto of radical, cosmic transformation, in which the lyrical subject rejects their entire former identity, described as a 'wretched and overgrown shell from childhood.' Liberation is to be achieved through the total annihilation of imperfection, conveyed by the powerful, scientific metaphor of being 'crushed in a hadronic singularity.' This is not an evolution, but a violent reset of being.",
    "The mechanism of rebirth is based on the concept of a 'tabula rasa' on a cosmic scale. The 'zeroed memory of the Universe' is to grant an 'unwritten body,' suggesting that memory and experience are the source of flaws, not the essence of being itself. Into this new body, a 'used soul without memories' is instilledâ€”eternal, yet cleansed of the baggage of the past. Identity is thus separated from history.",
    "The culmination and the titular 'promise' is a moral declaration: 'The new I will straighten my back and from now on I will be good.' The ultimate goal of this metaphysical operation is to achieve ethical purity. The poem suggests that true goodness is possible only after the complete erasure of the past. The promise is not of happiness or power, but of a fundamental moral transformation that can only occur after the death of the old self."
