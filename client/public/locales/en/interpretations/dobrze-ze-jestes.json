  "content": [
    "The poem 'It's Good That You Are' is a love litany that celebrates the existence of a beloved person on a transcendent plane, beyond physical presence and conventional feelings. Each stanza is built on a paradox: it affirms existence ('It's good that you are') while simultaneously emphasizing its immateriality ('though you are not here'). Love, longing, and crying exist, but they are detached from 'this world,' suggesting that the bond between the lyrical subject and the addressee is spiritual in nature.",
    "The central theme is the acceptance of the beloved's nature, which eludes earthly categories. Her love is 'fickle,' her longing is directed beyond the material world, and her trust is not based on her own heart. These traits, which in a standard interpretation might be seen as flaws, here become proof of her uniqueness and belonging to a different, higher reality.",
    "The poem's finale summarizes this paradoxical love. The beloved is 'the same, yet different,' highlighting her constant essence that simultaneously undergoes subtle, spiritual transformations. The final, simple declaration—'It's good that you are, Beloved'—dispenses with further explanation. It is an act of pure affirmation of an existence that is a value in itself, regardless of its form and manifestations. Love here becomes the acceptance of a mystery."
