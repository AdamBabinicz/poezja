  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'The Question'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'The Question' is a philosophical self-analysis in which the lyrical subject attempts to define their identity by negating its fundamental components. The questions 'Who would I be without sin?' and 'What would I be without love?' portray sin as a condition of humanity (in contrast to angelic or embryonic innocence) and love as a life-giving force, without which existence is empty and pointless ('a well without water').",
    "The structure of the poem leads the reader through these hypothetical states of lack, only to make a shocking turn in the finale. After asking questions about their own essence, the lyrical subject asks about the act of questioning itself: 'Who will ask who I am?'. This shift in perspective reveals the true tragedy of the work.",
    "The final lines—'Answers wander without questions, which no one has asked'—are the key to the interpretation. They suggest the existence of a world full of potential truths and meanings ('answers') that remain useless and solitary because the consciousness or courage to ask fundamental questions is missing. The problem lies not in the absence of answers, but in the absence of questions. The titular 'question' is what is most lacking in the world described by the poem, making it a place of profound, existential emptiness."
