  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'Worlds'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'Worlds' is a surreal vision of reality in which the boundaries between existence and non-existence are blurred. 'Non-existent worlds' inhabited by 'existing mouths' immediately introduce a paradox that defies logic. Basic actions, like eating and kissing, become cosmic acts trapped in a 'ceaseless vortex,' suggesting a cyclical nature and determinism that govern these dreamlike dimensions.",
    "The central theme is naivety and the inevitability of decay. The 'naive hand' that 'touches everything before it grows moss' symbolizes an innocent, cognitive curiosity that is nonetheless doomed to transience and old age. Similarly, 'wisdom will spill and fade,' indicating the fleeting nature of knowledge. The 'tree of events,' which continuously sprouts anew, emphasizes the eternal cycle of creation and destruction, in which each individual fate is merely a momentary episode.",
    "The poem concludes with a powerful vision of infinity that is both open and unaware of itself. 'Open infinity does not know its own name' suggests that the universe is purposeless and lacks self-awareness. In this space, an eternal rotation occurs: 'The unborn will yet be born, and the dead will die without end.' There is no ultimate salvation or conclusion hereâ€”only a ceaseless, mechanical process of being and dying that fills an unnamed, indifferent space."
