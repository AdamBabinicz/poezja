  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'Nostalgic Poem'",
  "content": [
    "This poem is a profound meditation on transience and memory, where nostalgia is not a sentimental recollection but a painful experience of physical loss. The images of 'Body to body, bones to bones' and the 'scent of moments' that has 'flown into the heavens' create a vision of a unity irrevocably destroyed by time. The desire to 'breathe it into the nostrils again' is a tragic attempt to reclaim the past, which ends in a confrontation with emptiness: 'The nostrils are gone - only bones remain.'",
    "The central theme is the dialectical struggle between life and death. The statement 'Life wants to live, and death to die' is paradoxical and points to the internal contradictions of both forces. Ultimately, however, an inversion occurs: 'Life will die, and death will live.' This dark thesis suggests that death is not an end but an eternal, dominant state that ultimately consumes ephemeral life.",
    "The poem concludes with a vision of resurrection and ultimate knowledge. When 'billions awaken,' the lyrical subject seeks not God, but a 'king with a crown'â€”a human, historical authority. The question of 'what it was really like' is not a question about the meaning of existence, but about historical truth, about facts hidden under the layers of time. The ultimate nostalgia is not for lost feelings, but for a lost truth that only the end of time can fully reveal."
