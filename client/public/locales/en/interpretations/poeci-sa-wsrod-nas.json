  "title": "AI Interpretation of the poem 'Poets Are Among Us'",
  "content": [
    "The poem 'Poets Are Among Us' radically redefines the poet, separating them from the act of writing. The lyrical subject reaches for 'volumes in which there is not a single poem,' introducing a paradoxical vision of the poet as a clairvoyant. True poets are not creators of words, but beings endowed with direct, intuitive insight into the structure of realityâ€”they know what will happen before it occurs, like observers of an inevitable scene.",
    "A key element is the nature of the knowledge these poets possess. It is not wisdom gained through effort or study, but 'ready solutions' they received before they 'delved into the deepest knowledge.' This suggests the existence of a gnostic, revealed understanding of fundamental truths about the purpose of 'the world and God.' Their wisdom is pre-rational and absolute, placing them beyond the reach of ordinary human comprehension.",
    "The lyrical subject acts as the sole witness to this hidden truth. Their statement, 'only I know that they know them,' emphasizes their profound alienation as well as their unique position. They do not possess the poets' knowledge, but they have the meta-knowledge of its existence. In this way, they become the guardian of a secret, confirming the existence of an order of cognition that eludes words and logic, accessible only to a select few, silent observers."
