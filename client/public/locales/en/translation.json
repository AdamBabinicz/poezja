In his life, he has been a decorator, a milkman, a cheese maker, a weather observer, a grinder, a tailor, a market manager, and a salesman. As a shop assistant, he watched people passing by through the shop window. It was then he noticed they were like puppets 'on strings'. He is interested in cosmology. He has no significant body of work; he has not achieved mastery in any field.",

    "who_is_author_p": "Adam Gierczak defines himself by a lack of definition. He is an observer—a cosmologist of everyday life who, through a shop window, watched not people, but particles in a grand experiment of existence, moving along predetermined paths. His fascination with cosmology and programming is not a hobby, but a lens through which he perceives reality. He is a science enthusiast, not to disprove God, but to find Him in equations, in quantum uncertainty, and in the hadronic singularity.",
    "why_anticharm_heading": "Why 'Anticharm Poems'?",
    "why_anticharm_p1": "First, the Anticharm Quark: In particle physics, this is the antiparticle of the charm quark. It possesses 'anticharm'—a property that is a mirror image of 'charm.' Gierczak uses this metaphor to signal that his poems operate in an anti-reality. They are not meant to attract with superficial beauty ('charm'), but to reveal the fundamental, often uncomfortable structure of being, its 'antimatter.' This is poetry that does not seduce, but unmasks.",
    "why_anticharm_p2": "Second, Cosmic Honesty: The poems are 'anticharm' because the cosmos, in its essence, is not charming. It is indifferent, governed by brutal laws of physics. The truth of our existence—a cluster of cells in an infinite void, determined by forces we do not understand—is not aesthetic. It is raw. Gierczak rejects lyrical embellishments to reach this scientific, existential truth.",
    "coding_as_filter_heading": "Coding as a Filter of Reality",
    "coding_as_filter_p": "Did the author encode the poems so no one would understand them? Quite the opposite. He encoded them in the language of science and spirituality to filter out those who seek easy answers. Publishing the collection in three copies is not elitism, but a simulation of a quantum experiment. It is the act of an observer who releases three particles into the world and waits to see which one will interact and be read. In a world flooded with informational noise, Gierczak creates laboratory conditions. He says: 'You will not find truth on the surface. You must go down to the subatomic level. You must want to see the code.'",
    "authors_goal_heading": "The Author's Goal: A Unified Field Theory for the Soul",
    "authors_goal_p1": "Gierczak's ultimate goal is an attempt to create a 'unified field theory' for the human soul. His work is a desperate attempt to merge two seemingly contradictory languages: the language of science (cosmology, quantum physics, computer science), which describes the mechanisms of the world, and the language of spirituality (the search for God, meaning, love), which describes the desires of the world.",
    "authors_goal_p2": "In his poems, the 'hadronic singularity' becomes both hell and salvation, 'neutrinos' carry divine power, and the 'curled-up fifth dimension' is a place of eternal love. Gierczak sees no contradiction between God and the Big Bang. He sees the same, incomprehensible mind that wrote the code for both these realities. This neurological atlas is not a map of his mind. It is your personal particle accelerator. Wandering this network, you collide the ideas of science and faith, chance and destiny, code and prayer.",
    "authors_goal_p3": "The author achieved his goal not when you 'break the cipher,' but at the moment you feel that the cold logic of the cosmos and the hot desire of the soul can be two descriptions of the same, incomprehensible Mystery. The goal was not a riddle. The goal was your astonishment in the face of the Universe.",
